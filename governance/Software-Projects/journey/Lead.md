# Lead

If you're responsible or are looking to become a leader a Foundation hosted Program or Project, or are a [Foundation corporate Member](finos.org/members), welcome and thank you!  It's community leaders like you that make the Foundation function.

To support you in your leadership capacity, we've prepared a Maintainers Cheatsheet that is intended to be a one-stop reference for all of the responsibilities, governance activities, and processes used by the Foundation.

And of course don't hesitate to get in [touch with Foundation staff](finos.org/contact-us) if you can't find the answer to a question.

## How do we measure success?
As a Leader of the Community it's important for you to be aware of this objectives to better understand the overall direction of the Foundation and the rationale behind Foundation team's recommendations.

As a Foundation Leader you should familiarize with:
- At Foundation level, FINOS goals are expressed with OKRs set by the Board every year for the FINOS team
- At Project Level, we rely on the definition of roadmaps (normally linked within the project's `README.md`) and [metrics](metrics.finos.org) to track process
