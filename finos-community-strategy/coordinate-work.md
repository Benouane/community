# Coordinate work through GitHub Issues, Discussions and FINOS Slack

## Take full advantage of GitHub Issues for work allocation

- Use GitHub Issues to create a backlog of well described work e.g. ([Legend](https://github.com/finos/legend/issues)).
- Allocate work to individuals so the team knows what they’re doing e.g ([FDC3](https://github.com/finos/fdc3/issues)).
- Invite external contribution with “Help Wanted” and “Good First Issue” labels.

## GitHub Discussions for Async Communication

- Use GitHub Discussions for new ideas and topics of interest e.g. ([CFI](https://github.com/finos/compliant-financial-infrastructure/discussions)).
