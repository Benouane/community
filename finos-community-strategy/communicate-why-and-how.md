# Communicate WHY and HOW the FINOS Community should contribute

Successful open source Projects and SIGs clearly communicate their purpose and tell people why and how they should contribute and consume. Look at [Morphir](https://github.com/finos/morphir), [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) for great examples.

## Update or Add Content to FINOS Project and SIG README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md

- Articulate your FINOS Project and SIG purpose in your README.md
  - Invite the team to review and feedback to make sure it makes sense.
- Update your CONTRIBUTING.md to include the following ...
  - How to get involved
  - Provide a Getting Started guide
  - Invite contributors to look through **open GitHub Issues**, **“Help Wanted”** and **“Good First Issues”**
  - Invite contributors to **open pull requests** and **fix bugs** and **contribute features**
  - Remember to invite the FINOS Community to open issues if bugs are found!

**Remember to update FINOS Project and SIG microsites to reflect consistent content!**
