## Ready to consume?
The first step in engaging with any open source initiative is typically to comsume the work produced so far, and the teams behind that work. If you've already identified [an open source component or open standard in our Landscape](https://landscape.finos.org) that you would like to use or build on, please do so!

## Discover interesting projects
We created the [FINOS Landscape](https://landscape.finos.org) to showcase all of our Special Interest Groups, Software and Standards Projects in an easily discoverable way, but we also encourage you to browse both our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/finos) and our [GitLab organization](https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation/) to find projects that are of interest to you. You're welcome and encouraged to reach out [through our mailing lists](https://community.finos.org/docs/journey/engage#mailing-lists) or [Slack Channel](https://finos-lf.slack.com/messages/finos-community/) or to email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) if you can find what you are looking for.

## Where are FINOS releases?
How a particular project asset is consumed will vary from project to project. [Software projects](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/#open-source-software-projects) publish releases open source repositories ([Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=org.finos), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=finos), [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=finos), [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/finos)), [Pypi](https://pypi.org/user/finos/)) while binary utilities may be also made available as GitHub/Gitlab downloads on the project's repository. The best way to determine how to consume a project's releases is to refer to that project's documentation. All of the above applies to [open standards projects](/docs/governance/Standards-Projects), such as [FDC3](https://fdc3.finos.org), as well. 

## Evaluating maturity of our projects 
We encourage you to thoughtfully assess not only the **value** and **fit for purpose**, but also the **maturity** of both the technology and the team that produced a particular code asset. Evaluating the project's momentum and longevity will help you assess the level of technical risk that you may be taking on when leveraging it. FINOS provides tools to help the community in these assessments, particularly:

- The [Project Lifecycle](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/project-lifecycle) which provides a single overall measure of the maturity of our projects
- The [Metrics Dashboard](https://metrics.finos.org) which provides transparent analytics on the activity of each of our Projects and SIGs

Once you've identified suitable components we encourage you to consume them in your own software development efforts! 

## FINOS ensures Security and IP Compliance of our projects
As an open source community in a regulated industry, we are well aware of the strong enterprise requirements of our project consumers. That is why we require [strict IP compliance requirements](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution-compliance-requirements), enforced via [EasyCLA](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/easycla) and increasingly mandatory [security scanning](https://community.finos.org/docs/development-infrastructure/code-validation/whitesource), backed [by a responsible disclosure policy](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/cve-responsible-disclosure).

## Ready to contribute back?
As you consume FINOS projects, you may be willing to take an active role in the development by [Engaging](/docs/journey/engage) with or [Contributing](https://community.finos.org/docs/journey/participate/) to that project. As an open community, we encourage you to participate in the Projects or Special Interest Groups (SIGs) whose work you consume!

## Does your firm need help contribute?
If you need help consuming Open Source Code, the [FINOS Open Source Readiness (OSR) Initiative](https://www.finos.org/open-source-readiness) exists to support financial services organizations in their open source maturity journey. Get in touch and start realizing the benefits of open source code and collaboration today. The [Knowledge Base](https://www.finos.org/knowledge-base) also provides a wealth of information to get your started.
