## Participating in a Project
One of the best things about open source in general, and the modern "social collaboration" workflow in particular, is that participation isn't restricted to a core development team.  Anyone can fork a project at any time, make some changes to it, and submit those changes back for review and incorporation into the software, potentially sparking a long and productive collaboration.

Because the Foundation uses public GitHub repositories for all source code management, [their process](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking) is what's used by the Foundation to support this workflow.

If you have an interest in participating in a project but you're not sure where to start, some project teams will label issues with `Help Wanted` or `Good First Issue` labels; ideas to get involved are also socialized in the foundation's "This Week at FINOS" weekly email (published via the [Community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/g/community)). These issues and calls for help are a great way to get started on contributing to a project, as they've been pre-vetted by the project team and generally won't be overly complex or time consuming to implement.

The Foundation also encourages non-code contributions in the form of issues (bug reports and enhancement requests), documentation updates, and so forth. These are also highly valued contributions, and project teams typically appreciate this kind of input just as much as code-level contributions.  Most projects host an issue tracker on their GitHub repository, and if not will provide instructions on where issues should be raised instead.

Participation in any FINOS activity is open to anyone, whether you work in the industry or not. Come join us in making Financial Services a more innovative and productive industry!

That being said, for a pull request to be merged (accepted) you will need to have met our contribution requirements; notably you will be required to have a CLA on file with us. The Foundation uses a GitHub bot to automatically validate CLAs each time a pull request is submitted to a Foundation-hosted project, so don't be shy about submitting a pull request even if you don't have a CLA yet, as doing so will initiate the process. See [Contribution Compliance Requirements](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution-compliance-requirements) for more detail.

Some Projects may have additional contributing guidelines; for example requiring a particular coding standard. These will usually be documented using [GitHub's Contributing Guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/) feature, meaning that you will see a link to the guidelines from various places in the GitHub UI.  Before contributing to a project you should ensure you've familiarized yourself with the project's contributing guidelines, as doing so will help minimize the number of spurious review and edit cycles the PR needs to go through. As a Project Lead you can leverage the template [Project Blueprint](https://github.com/finos/software-project-blueprint) provided by FINOS to jumpstart your project with proper contribution guidelines.

## Participating in a Special Interest Group (SIG)
SIGs welcome subject matter experts to join them on collaborating on the development of modern standards relevant to the Financial Services industry.  The best way to start participating in a SIG is to subscribe to the group's mailing list, attend the group's scheduled calls, and use both to get a sense of the current priorities of the group and their working model.

SIGs are expected to document participation eligibility criteria, their mailing list information and meeting information on their wiki page, located within the respective GitHub repository.

Participation in a SIG involves the opportunity for a contributor to join and - critically, speak at, SIG meeting calls, and post to the WG's mailing list, in order to express their opinions.

SIGs may create and enforce additional participation eligibility criteria or requirements; an example might be to require a particular area of industry expertise (e.g., interest rate swaps) or knowledge of a programming language (e.g., C++) or library. These criteria should also be clearly documented on the SIG's documentation page.

### Different types of Participation

#### Active participation
The FINOS Community is based on the "governance by contribution" principles. Therefore we encourage participants to Projects and SIGs to take an active role by contributing actual code or sweat equity (taking the minutes, follow up on action points to meetings, etc).

#### Passive Participation
Another option, geared for those new or unfamiliar with a SIG, is passive (listen-only / read-only) participation. Passive participation allows those in the FINOS Community so inclined to check out a SIG for a bit to see if they'd like to get involved on an on-going basis, usually with an eye towards demonstrable active participation. Other than possibly a brief introduction at the start of the call, it's expected that passive participants are essentially auditing the calls (and/or reading mailing list threads and Github issues, as the case may be) in listen-only (or read-only) mode. Moderators of meetings may choose to open a SIG meeting to questions from passive participants if they choose, but are under no obligation to do so. Critically, passive participation, by either an individual or organization, is intended to be finite and limited in duration.

The primary purpose of passive participation is to provide an opportunity for potential participants newer to the SIG or project to understand the topics discussed, depth of the discussions, and/or any technical/product/industry experience expected for on-going participation.

Passive participation is not intended to be used for indefinite auditing or non-collaborative purpose (e.g. seeking competitive insights). Passive participants will typically attend a limited number of meetings, after which they'll seek to join as a participant (and have met any eligibility criteria, if they exist) or cease attending.
