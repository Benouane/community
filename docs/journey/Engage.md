## Mailing Lists
All of the mailing lists described on this page can be subscribed to either by visiting the web archive link (which may be blocked by some firms), or by sending an email to `<list-name>+subscribe@finos.org`(which should be available to employees of most firms).

For example, to subscribe to announce@finos.org, email [announce+subscribe@finos.org](mailto:announce+subscribe@finos.org); below you can find the the links to most populated lists of our community.

Note that membership in some lists is restricted, and requests to subscribe to those lists may be rejected if membership requirements aren't met.

To help control spam, all Foundation mailing lists that allow posting by the general public are moderated, which can result in slight delays in delivery.

If you've sent an email to one of these lists and haven't received any acknowledgement, or don't see it in the web archive, please notify the Foundation's help alias and we'll look into it for you.

## Online Chat
Many members of our community use the Symphony platform for regulated, secure online chat, and we encourage all community members who do not have an account on a corporate Symphony "pod" (tenant) to sign up for a free account on Symphony LLC's public pod.  Once registered, you will be discoverable to other members of the community, and can initiate and participate in online chats.

Alternatively, we provide a Slack instance on [finos-lf.slack.com](https://finos-lf.slack.com); you can request access to [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org).
