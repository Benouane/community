If you are a FINOS project maintainer, looking to lead a FINOS-hosted project, and/or a [FINOS member](https://finos.org/members), welcome and thank you!  It is community leaders like you who drive FINOS' success.

## FINOS Maintainers
Each FINOS project and SIG has a community of [participants](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Software-Projects/CONTRIBUTING.template.md#roles), also referred to as "contributors", and [maintainers](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Software-Projects/CONTRIBUTING.template.md#roles).

A **contributor** is anyone who submits a contribution to the project. Contributions include code & pull requests, issues, comments, documentation, media, or any combination of the above.

A **maintainer** is a contributor who, by virtue of their contribution history, has been given [write access](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository-roles-for-organizations) to project repositories and may approve and merge contributions to the project.

It is possible, and advised, that projects have multiple maintainers, in which case maintainers will elect one or two **lead maintainers**. The lead maintainer is the project's interface with the FINOS Team and Governing Board. Lead maintainers are responsible for communicating with the FINOS Team, Governing Board and Community on behalf of the project. The lead maintainer(s) are also accountable for steering project direction and prioritisation with the rest of the project community. They are also accountable for the quality of deliverables produced by the project community.

FINOS standards projects can also have [editors](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/5._Governance.md#1roles).

To support you in your leadership capacity, we've prepared a [FINOS Maintainers Cheatsheet](https://odp.finos.org/docs/finos-maintainers-cheatsheet/) that is intended to be a one-stop reference for all of the responsibilities, governance activities, and processes used by the Foundation.

And of course don't hesitate to [get in touch with Foundation staff](https://finos.org/contact-us) if you can't find the answer to a question.
