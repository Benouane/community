# FINOS Community 2022 Strategic Overview

There are many communities surrounding FINOS, with Projects and SIGs attracting people from lots of different backgrounds, that we should all work to Recruit, Reward and Retain in 2022.

The FINOS Community Strategy centers around the FINOS Community On Ramp that implements an approach for directly educating, growing and rewarding FINOS OSS contributors.

## FINOS Community On Ramp Steps

1. FINOS contributors should know why they should contribute to FINOS Projects and SIGs.
2. Projects and tools should be installed locally in 10 mins or less. Think engineering experience.
3. FINOS Projects and SIGs should publish and educate how contributors can get involved.
4. Backlog items tagged Good First Issues and ideally assigned to individuals and communicated via Calls / GitHub / FINOS Slack.
5. FINOS Project and SIG communities should work to resolve blockers & answer questions fast.
6. Contributions, achievements and releases should be publicly celebrated.
