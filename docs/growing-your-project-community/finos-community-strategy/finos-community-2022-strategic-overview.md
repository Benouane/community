3. FINOS Projects and SIGs should publish and educate how contributors can get involved.
4. Backlog items tagged Good First Issues and ideally assigned to individuals and communicated via Calls / GitHub / FINOS Slack.
5. FINOS Project and SIG communities should work to resolve blockers & answer questions fast.
6. Contributions, achievements and releases should be publicly celebrated.
