# Provide an amazing engineering experience for first time contributors

Sometimes having documentation isnâ€™t enough for attracting contributors and scaling your projects. Engineering Experience is about leveraging technology to demonstrate impact in under 10 mins.

## Explore cloud and open source projects / platforms for mechanisms of fast deployment

- JavaScript libraries should leverage NPM for fast deployment and usage.
- JavaScript frameworks should leverage NPX for quick deployment and configuration.
- FINOS SIGs should utilize markdown and microsites for publishing and consuming materials fast.
- Docker and containers should be leveraged for deploying complex software systems.
- Cloud services should be leveraged as an alternative to self hosting systems.
- Kubernetes should be leveraged for deploying hybrid cloud and locally run systems.
- Juju and Charms can be used for Kubernetes deployment and day two system orchestration.

**Why invest in an awesome engineering experience?**
Easy and speed of deployment enables innovation, playful experiments and lowers the barrier of entry to open source consumption and contribution. When you deploy fast, you can run hackathons!
